# SNAKE_GAME
Snake Game
This is a classic Snake Game from the old Nokia 3310 built with Python and Turtle.

Getting Started
To get started with the game, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Playing the Game
To play the game, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Joram21/SNAKE_GAME.git

Then, navigate to the cloned repository and run the following command:
python3 snake_game2.py

Use the arrow keys or w,s,a,d to control the snake and try to eat as much food as possible without running into the walls or the snake's body. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or its own body.
